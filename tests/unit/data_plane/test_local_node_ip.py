"""Unit tests for _get_local_node_ip and the MC_TCP_BIND_ADDRESS env-var
assignment in the mooncake_cpu adapter path.

Covers P3: multi-node correctness of the per-process IP binding.

The helper rejects two classes of non-routable address:
* link-local (169.254/16, fe80::/10) — APIPA via ``avahi-autoipd``
* loopback (127.0.0.0/8, ::1) — when ``/etc/hosts`` maps the
  hostname to 127.0.0.1
