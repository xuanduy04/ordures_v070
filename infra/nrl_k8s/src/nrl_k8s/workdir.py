"""Stage a working directory for Ray Job ``runtime_env.working_dir`` upload.

Ray's client-side packager honours ``.gitignore``, which silently drops
training jsonls under ``resources_servers/*/data/`` — we strip those files
from the staged copy so Ray uploads the data. We also skip caches/venvs/git
to keep the zip under Ray's 100 MiB dashboard cap.

Each call stages into a fresh tmpdir; the caller owns cleanup (Ray uploads
to GCS before the SDK call returns, so deletion is safe afterwards).
