"""Build and apply KubeRay ``RayJob`` objects.

A RayJob is a RayCluster + Ray Job rolled into one K8s resource: KubeRay
creates the cluster, waits for it to become ready, submits ``spec.entrypoint``
over the dashboard HTTP API, polls until terminal, then (optionally) tears
the whole cluster down. It is the convenient shape for one-shot runs where
you do *not* want a long-lived RayCluster left behind.

The inline RayCluster body comes from the recipe — this module reuses
:func:`nrl_k8s.manifest.build_raycluster_manifest` to get the patched cluster
manifest, then lifts its ``.spec`` under ``rayClusterSpec`` and wraps a
RayJob envelope around it.

    """Wrap a RayCluster inline body in a RayJob envelope.

    Args:
        cluster: the training ClusterSpec used for ``rayClusterSpec``.
        infra: top-level infra — supplies namespace, image, pullSecrets, SA.
            These are applied inside the rayClusterSpec identically to how
            the standalone RayCluster path patches them.
        entrypoint: shell command KubeRay submits via HTTP to the dashboard.
            Typically ``infra.launch.entrypoint``.
        name: RayJob metadata name. Defaults to the cluster's name —
            convenient because ``nrl-k8s job list`` on an ephemeral cluster
            can still resolve by that name.
        shutdown_after_finishes: KubeRay deletes the RayCluster once the
            Ray Job reaches a terminal state. Leave True for one-shot runs.
        ttl_seconds_after_finished: seconds to keep the RayJob object
            around after the job reaches Complete/Failed. After the TTL
            the garbage collector removes the RayJob (and the cluster,
            when ``shutdown_after_finishes=True``).
        submission_mode: KubeRay submission path. ``HTTPMode`` posts the
            entrypoint to the dashboard (same code path as Ray Job SDK).
            ``K8sJobMode`` creates a separate K8s Job, which breaks KAI
            gang scheduling — leave this at the default unless you know
            you need the other shape.
        extra_labels: merged on top of infra + cluster labels on the RayJob.
            Used by callers to tag runs (e.g. ``disagg.nemo-rl/run-id``).
