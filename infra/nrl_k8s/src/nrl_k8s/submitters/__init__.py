"""Training-job submitters.

Two transports, same shape. The abstraction keeps the orchestrator and CLI
agnostic about whether a run lives under Ray's Job framework or as a raw
process on the head pod.

* :class:`PortForwardSubmitter` opens a brief ``kubectl port-forward`` to
  the head dashboard and uses Ray's ``JobSubmissionClient``. The Ray job
  carries a submission id the dashboard tracks. Dev-iteration default.

* :class:`ExecSubmitter` shells into the head pod with ``kubectl exec``
  and launches the entrypoint as a ``nohup`` process — the same shape as
  a Slurm driver on a login node. Production / batch default. There is
  no Ray Job abstraction on this path; training code calls
  ``ray.init(address="auto")`` to attach to the already-running head.

Handles are persisted to ``~/.cache/nrl-k8s/runs/<run-id>.json`` so that
``nrl-k8s job logs`` / ``job stop`` on a later invocation knows which
transport to talk to.
