# This directory contains NeMo-RL configuration files for nemo_gym environments.
# It is NOT the nemo_gym library — that lives in 3rdparty/Gym-workspace/Gym/.
#
# Problem: when Python runs `examples/run_grpo.py`, it inserts `examples/` into
# sys.path[0]. Python's PathFinder then finds this directory as a namespace
# package (no __init__.py → __file__ = None → "(unknown location)"), shadowing
# the real nemo_gym library before the editable-install finder can reach it.
#
# Fix: when imported as the top-level `nemo_gym` package (__name__ == "nemo_gym"),
# temporarily filter `examples/` out of sys.path, import the real nemo_gym, then
# replace this placeholder module in sys.modules with the real one.
#
# When imported as `examples.nemo_gym` (e.g. from unit tests that do
# `from examples.nemo_gym import run_distillation_nemo_gym`), no redirect is
# needed — this directory already behaves as a normal Python package.
