# Reward Model Training in NeMo RL

This document explains how to train reward models (RM) within NeMo RL. Currently, only Bradley-Terry reward models are supported on the DTensor backend. Megatron backend support is tracked [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/issues/720).

## Launch a Training Job

The script, [examples/run_rm.py](../../examples/run_rm.py), is used to train a Bradley-Terry reward model. This script can be launched either locally or via Slurm. For details on how to set up Ray and launch a job using Slurm, refer to the [cluster documentation](../cluster.md).

Be sure to launch the job using `uv`. The command to launch a training job is as follows:

```bash
uv run examples/run_rm.py

# Can also add overrides on CLI, like changing the config or changing the model
uv run examples/run_rm.py --config examples/configs/rm.yaml policy.model_name=Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B
```

The default YAML config shares the same base template as the SFT config but includes a new `reward_model_cfg` section with `enabled: true` to load the model as a Reward Model. You can find an example RM config file at [examples/configs/rm.yaml](../../examples/configs/rm.yaml).

**Reminder**: Set your `HF_HOME`, `WANDB_API_KEY`, and `HF_DATASETS_CACHE` (if needed). Make sure to log in using `huggingface-cli` if you're working with Llama models.

## Datasets

RM datasets in NeMo RL are encapsulated using classes. Each RM data class is expected to have the following attributes:
  1. `dataset`: A dictionary containing the formatted datasets. Each example in the dataset must conform to the format described below.
  2. `task_name`: A string identifier that uniquely identifies the dataset.

If your data is not in the correct format, simply write a preprocessing script to convert the data into this format. An example implementation can be found in [preference_datasets/tulu3.py](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/preference_datasets/tulu3.py).

**Note:** The `task_name` field is required in each formatted example.

```json
{
  "context": [], // list of dicts - The prompt message (including previous turns, if any)
  "completions": [ // list of dicts — The list of completions
    {
      "rank": 0, // int — The rank of the completion (lower rank is preferred)
      "completion": [] // list of dicts — The completion message(s)
    },
    {
      "rank": 1, // int — The rank of the completion (lower rank is preferred)
      "completion": [] // list of dicts — The completion message(s)
    }
  ],
  "task_name": "task_name" // identifier for the task
}
```

Currently, RM training supports only two completions (where the lowest rank is preferred and the highest one is rejected), with each completion being a single response. For example:
```json
{
    "context": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What's the capital of France?"
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "The capital of France is Paris."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Thanks! And what's the capital of Germany?"
        }
    ],
    "completions": [
        {
            "rank": 0,
            "completion": [
                {
                    "role": "assistant",
                    "content": "The capital of Germany is Berlin."
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "rank": 1,
            "completion": [
                {
                    "role": "assistant",
                    "content": "The capital of Germany is Munich."
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "task_name": "task_name"
}
```

By default, NeMo RL has support for [HelpSteer3](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/preference_datasets/helpsteer3.py) and [Tulu3Preference](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/preference_datasets/tulu3.py) datasets. Both of these datasets are downloaded from HuggingFace and preprocessed on-the-fly, so there's no need to provide a path to any datasets on disk.

We provide a [PreferenceDataset](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/preference_datasets/preference_dataset.py) class that is compatible with jsonl-formatted preference datasets for loading datasets from local path or Hugging Face. You can modify your config as follows to use such a custom preference dataset:
```yaml
data:
  # other data settings, see `examples/configs/dpo.yaml` for more details
  ...
  # dataset settings
  train:
    # this dataset will override prompt_key and use the default values for other vars
    data_path: /path/to/local/train_dataset.jsonl  # local file or hf_org/hf_dataset_name (HuggingFace)
    subset: null  # used for HuggingFace datasets
    split: train  # used for HuggingFace datasets
  validation:
    # this dataset will use the default values for other vars except data_path
    data_path: /path/to/local/val_dataset.jsonl
  default:
    # will use below vars as default values if dataset doesn't specify it
    dataset_name: PreferenceDataset
    prompt_file: null
    system_prompt_file: null
  # multiple validation sets is supported by using val_data_paths
  # this will be removed after refactor
  val_data_paths:
    <NameOfValidationDataset1>: /path/to/local/val_dataset_1.jsonl
    <NameOfValidationDataset2>: /path/to/local/val_dataset_2.jsonl
```

Your JSONL files should contain one JSON object per line with the following structure:

```json
{
  "context": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is 2+2?"}], // list of dicts - The prompt message (including previous turns, if any)
  "completions": [ // list of dicts — The list of completions
    {
      "rank": 0, // int — The rank of the completion (lower rank is preferred)
      "completion": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is 4."}] // list of dicts — The completion message(s)
    },
    {
      "rank": 1, // int — The rank of the completion (lower rank is preferred)
      "completion": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't know."}] // list of dicts — The completion message(s)
    }
  ]
}
```

We also provide a [BinaryPreferenceDataset](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/preference_datasets/binary_preference_dataset.py) class, which is a simplified version of PreferenceDataset for pairwise ranked preference with single turn completions. You can use `prompt_key`, `chosen_key` and `rejected_key` to specify which fields in your data correspond to the question, chosen answer and rejected answer respectively. Here's an example configuration:
```yaml
data:
  # other data settings, see `examples/configs/dpo.yaml` for more details
  ...
  # dataset settings
  train:
    # this dataset will override prompt_key and use the default values for other vars
    data_path: /path/to/local/train_dataset.jsonl  # local file or hf_org/hf_dataset_name (HuggingFace)
    prompt_key: context
    subset: null  # used for HuggingFace datasets
    split: train  # used for HuggingFace datasets
  validation:
    # this dataset will use the default values for other vars except data_path
    data_path: /path/to/local/val_dataset.jsonl
  default:
    # will use below vars as default values if dataset doesn't specify it
    dataset_name: BinaryPreferenceDataset
    prompt_key: prompt
    chosen_key: chosen
    rejected_key: rejected
    prompt_file: null
    system_prompt_file: null
```

Your JSONL files should contain one JSON object per line with the following structure:

```json
{
  "prompt": "What is 2+2?",     // <prompt_key>: <prompt_content>
  "chosen": "The answer is 4.", // <chosen_key>: <chosen_content>
  "rejected": "I don't know."   // <rejected_key>: <rejected_content>
}
```

### Custom datasets defined outside NeMo RL

If you want to plug in a preference dataset class that lives outside the
`nemo_rl` package (so you don't have to edit the built-in registry), set
`dataset_name` to a fully qualified dotted import path. The dispatcher
will import the module and resolve the class. The class must accept the
same kwargs as the built-in datasets (i.e. the full data config) and
implement `set_task_spec`.

```yaml
data:
  default:
    dataset_name: my_pkg.my_module.MyPreferenceDataset  # importable from PYTHONPATH
```

The class must be importable — install it as a package or add its
parent directory to `PYTHONPATH` before launching training.

Please note:
- If you are using a logger, the prefix used for each validation set will be `validation-<NameOfValidationDataset>`. The total validation time, summed across all validation sets, is reported under `timing/validation/total_validation_time`.
- If you are doing checkpointing, the `metric_name` value in your `checkpointing` config should reflect the metric and validation set to be tracked. For example, `validation-<NameOfValidationDataset1>_loss`.

## Using Reward Models as Environments

Trained reward models can be used as environments in GRPO training for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This allows you to use your trained reward model to provide rewards during policy optimization.

### Reward Model Environment

The Reward Model Environment provides a standardized interface for using trained reward models in RL training:

```python
from nemo_rl.environments.reward_model_environment import RewardModelEnvironment

env_config = {
    "enabled": True,
    "model_name": "path/to/your/trained/reward/model",
    "tokenizer": {"name": "path/to/your/trained/reward/model"},
    "precision": "bfloat16",
    "batch_size": 32,
    "resources": {"gpus_per_node": 1, "num_nodes": 1},
    "reward_model_cfg": {
        "enabled": True,
        "reward_model_type": "bradley_terry",
    },
}

reward_env = RewardModelEnvironment.remote(env_config)
```

### Integration with GRPO

To use your trained reward model with GRPO, you can use the [examples/run_grpo.py](../../examples/run_grpo.py) script with the [examples/configs/grpo_rm_1B.yaml](../../examples/configs/grpo_rm_1B.yaml) config:

```bash
# Run GRPO training with your trained reward model
uv run examples/run_grpo.py --config examples/configs/grpo_rm_1B.yaml
```

### Configuration

In your GRPO configuration, specify the reward model environment:

```yaml
env:
  reward_model:
    enabled: true
    model_name: "path/to/your/trained/reward/model"
    tokenizer:
      name: "path/to/your/trained/reward/model"
    precision: "bfloat16"
    batch_size: 32
    resources:
      gpus_per_node: 1
      num_nodes: 1
    reward_model_cfg:
      enabled: true
      reward_model_type: "bradley_terry"
```
