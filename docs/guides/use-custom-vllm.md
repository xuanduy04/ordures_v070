# Experiment with Custom vLLM

This guide explains how to use your own version of vLLM while leveraging a pre-compiled vLLM wheel, so you don't have to recompile the C++ source code.

## Clone and Build Your Custom vLLM

Clone your vLLM fork and build it using the provided script. For example:

```sh
# Usage: bash tools/build-custom-vllm.sh <GIT_URL> <GIT_REF> <VLLM_PRECOMPILED_WHEEL_LOCATION>
bash tools/build-custom-vllm.sh https://github.com/terrykong/vllm.git terryk/demo-custom-vllm https://wheels.vllm.ai/862f2ef893d9751db0a92bd2d4ae0e3d9677872f/vllm-1.0.0.dev-cp38-abi3-manylinux1_x86_64.whl

# [INFO] pyproject.toml updated. NeMo RL is now configured to use the local vLLM at 3rdparty/vllm.
# [INFO] Verify this new vllm version by running:
#
# VLLM_PRECOMPILED_WHEEL_LOCATION=http://.....whl \
#   uv run --extra vllm vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
#
# [INFO] For more information on this custom install, visit https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/blob/main/docs/guides/use-custom-vllm.md
# [IMPORTANT] Remember to set the shell variable 'VLLM_PRECOMPILED_WHEEL_LOCATION' when running NeMo RL apps with this custom vLLM to avoid re-compiling.
```

This script does the following:
1. Clones the `vllm` you specify at a particular branch.
2. Builds `vllm`.
3. Updates NeMo RL's pyproject.toml to work with this `vllm`.
4. Updates `uv.lock`.

Make sure to add the updated `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` to version control so that your branch can be reproduced by others.

## Verify Your Custom vLLM in Isolation
Test your setup to ensure your custom vLLM is being used:
```sh
uv run --extra vllm python -c 'import vllm; print(f"Successfully imported vLLM version: {vllm.__version__}")'
# Uninstalled 1 package in 1ms
# Installed 1 package in 2ms
# Hi! If you see this, you're using a custom version of vLLM for the purposes of this tutorial
# INFO 06-18 09:22:44 [__init__.py:244] Automatically detected platform cuda.
# Successfully imported vLLM version: 0.0.1.dev1+g69d5add74.d20250910
```

If you don't see the log message `Hi! If you see this...`, it's because this message is unique to the tutorial's specific `vLLM` fork. It was added in [this commit](https://github.com/terrykong/vllm/commit/69d5add744e51b988e985736f35c162d3e87b683) and doesn't exist in the main `vLLM` project.

## Running NeMo RL Apps with Custom vLLM

To ensure the custom vLLM install is setup properly in NeMo RL applications, always run the following before anything:

```sh
# Ensures vLLM uses the precompiled wheel and avoids recompiling C++ sources
export VLLM_PRECOMPILED_WHEEL_LOCATION=https://wheels.vllm.ai/862f2ef893d9751db0a92bd2d4ae0e3d9677872f/vllm-1.0.0.dev-cp38-abi3-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
# Ensures worker venvs are rebuilt to use the custom vLLM. Otherwise it may use the cached version in cached venvs
export NRL_FORCE_REBUILD_VENVS=true
# This isn't necessary if you only do `uv run foobar.py`, but may be needed if you switching between optional extras `uv run --extra vllm foobar.py`. If you are unsure if you need this, it's safer to include it.
uv pip install setuptools_scm
```

Then run your application:
```sh
uv run examples/run_grpo.py
```

## Re-building the NeMo RL Docker Image

Using a custom vllm may require you to rebuild the docker image. The two most common reasons are:

1. The `ray` version was changed, so you **must** rebuild the image to allow `ray.sub` to start the ray cluster with the same version as the application.
2. Many dependencies changed and add a large overhead when `NRL_FORCE_REBUILD_VENVS=true` is set to rebuild venvs, so you wish to cache the dependencies in the image to avoid re-build/re-pulling wheels.

For convenience, you can have the image build your custom vLLM by running the same script inside the Docker build.
Pass `--build-arg BUILD_CUSTOM_VLLM=1` to enable this path; the build will create `3rdparty/vllm` and source `3rdparty/vllm/nemo-rl.env` automatically.

```sh
docker buildx build \
  --build-arg BUILD_CUSTOM_VLLM=1 \
  --target release \
  --build-context nemo-rl=. \
  -f docker/Dockerfile \
  --tag <registry>/nemo-rl:latest \
  --push \
  .
```

### SSH Setup for Private Repositories

If your custom vLLM is hosted in a **private repository** (e.g., internal GitLab), you need to set up SSH agent forwarding for Docker to clone it during the build.

#### Prerequisites
1. Your SSH key must be registered on the Git server (GitLab/GitHub)
2. The key must **not be expired** - check your Git server's SSH key settings
3. The key must be loaded into your local ssh-agent

#### Step 1: Verify your SSH key works

```sh
# For GitLab (adjust host/port as needed)
ssh -T git@gitlab.example.com -p 12051

# You should see: "Welcome to GitLab, @username!"
# If you see "Your SSH key has expired", renew it on the server
```

#### Step 2: Load your SSH key into the agent

```sh
# Check if an ssh-agent is already running
echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK

# If empty, start one (this also sets SSH_AUTH_SOCK which `docker buildx` expects to be set when using `--ssh default`)
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Clear any old/expired keys from the agent
ssh-add -D

# Add your SSH key (use the key registered on your Git server)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Verify it's loaded
ssh-add -l
```

#### Step 3: Run the Docker build with SSH forwarding

```sh
docker buildx build \
  --build-arg BUILD_CUSTOM_VLLM=1 \
  --target release \
  --build-context nemo-rl=. \
  -f docker/Dockerfile \
  --ssh default \
  --tag <registry>/nemo-rl:latest \
  --push \
  .
```

## Running Applications with a Custom vLLM Container

When using a container built with custom vLLM, **use the frozen environment workflow** (bare `python`) instead of `uv run` with `NRL_FORCE_REBUILD_VENVS=true`.

```sh
# Recommended: use bare python (frozen environment)
python examples/run_grpo.py

# NOT recommended with custom vLLM containers:
# uv run examples/run_grpo.py
# or
# NRL_FORCE_REBUILD_VENVS=true uv run examples/run_grpo.py
```

### Why Not Use `uv run` or Rebuild Venvs?

Rebuilding worker virtual environments (via `uv run` or `NRL_FORCE_REBUILD_VENVS=true`) requires having the custom vLLM compiled locally. However, compiling vLLM requires a container environment with the correct CUDA toolchain—creating a chicken-and-egg problem.

The container already has vLLM built and cached in the frozen environments. Using bare `python` leverages these pre-built environments directly, avoiding the need to recompile vLLM at runtime.

> [!TIP]
> For more details on frozen environments and how they differ from `uv run`, see the [Dependency Management](../design-docs/dependency-management.md#frozen-environments) documentation.
